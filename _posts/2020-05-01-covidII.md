Now that our Covid-19 map is up and running, let's create a Heroku-hosted flask app to make it available online.


### 1. Creating a flask app

With the legend out of the way, let's create a web app to display our map. This is where [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) steps in. Flask is a python web microframework, designed to be simple, yet extensible. 

No big surprise here: the first thing to do is to import `flask`. We will also need `os` along the way:

```python
from flask import Flask
import os
```

We can now comment out the code line used to save our map as an html file, since we won't need it anymore:

```python
#Coda.map.save("./COVID_map.html")
```

Instead, let's append the following code block at the end of our script:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def display_map():
     CODA = create_map()
     return CODA.map._repr_html_()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Good news: this code block is barely more complicated than [flask's *Hello World*](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)!
```python app = Flask(__name__)``` creates the `app` object, an instance of the `Flask` class; this is done by passing the `__name__` argument to the `Flask`constructor.
The next step is to tell `app` how to process incoming requests. This is achived using the `route()` dectorator, which binds the function `display_map()` to URL `'/'`. In other words, when the application receives a request where the path is `'/'`, it invokes `display_map()`.

What `display_map()` does, is simply call our `create_map()` function and display the `CODA` object it returns using `_repr_html_()`.

Last but not least, the app is started by using the `run()` method. Here neither host nor port are specified, so `host` defaults to the localhost and port defauts to 5000.

We're done! If you run the script and type "127.0.0.1:5000/" into your browser, you should see the map popping up!
Right now, it only runs locally, but we are just one step away from making it available online.

Let's go ahead and change the last line of the script to:

```python 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=os.environ.get('PORT', 80))
```


### 2. Hosting the app on heroku

We will operate our application from [Heroku](www.heroku.com), a cloud application platform.
In this example, we will deploy the app from Git, so let's initialize a repo in the folder where the script is being kept. It is crucial to initialize *in the folder containing the script files*; if your .git file is one folder up or one folder down, you will run into deployment issues.

For the sake of simplicity you can clone the repo available here [here](https://github.com/Ovide19/covid19-viz-blog). 

If you take a peek into the GitHub repo, you will notice three additional files, needed by Heroku to launch the app:
- **runtime.txt** 
- **requirements.txt**
- **Procfile**

**runtime.txt** tells heroku which language it's dealing with, namely Python:

```
python-3.8.2
```

**requirements.txt** lists the app dependencies: it basically tells the Python package installer `pip` which modules to install. 
Note that you can force a specific version, or a version range, for any given package.

```
flask 
folium==0.6.0
rtree>=0.8,<0.9
rasterio
earthpy
gunicorn
unidecode
```

Finally, ***Procfile*** (*without* a .txt extension!) tells Heroku which commands to run to deploy the Python app:

```
web: gunicorn 2020-05-01_covidII:app
```

Here, the green unicorn, *a.k.a.* `gunicorn` (specified in ***requirements.txt***), handles the requests made to the app upon deployment. ***Procfile*** also specifies the name of the app: `2020-05-01_covidII`.

Great! The worst is behind us!

Go ahead and create a Heroku account and head over to your dashboard. Click on the top right "New" button and select "Create a new app" in the dropdown menu:

 Heroku will ask to specify the app name, as well as the server region. Here I go for covid19-viz-blog. Go ahead a hit the "Create app" button.

Heroku supports different deployment methods; in this example, we will go with GitHub, so click on the GitHub button in the middle, specify the repo to connect to and hit the "Search" button:

![Connecting to the repo](/blog/assets/images/heroku3.jpg)

Upon connecting to the repo, Heroku allows to choose the branch to deploy. For the time being, our repo only has a single `master` branch, so let's go ahead and deploy it. Boom! You should see all sorts of things happening in your build log:

We're almost there! If all goes well, meaning you do not have any build problem, you should now be able to switch to the "Activity" tab and hit the top right "Open App" button. This should fire up your navigator and display the map:

### 3. What next?

There are tons of ways to improve this map.

Our first hack was to display the number of cases that happened over the past 24 hours. Now that the epidemic peak is behind us, seeing the daily number of casualties decreasing over time is definitely lifting our spirits.

Last but not least, you will notice that it might take a couple of seconds for Heroku to display the map. A way to improve this would be to use a job scheduler to pre-load the csv file prior to displaying the map. But that's another story!
