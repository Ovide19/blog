Why not take advantage of Python's [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html) mapping library to visualize the COVID-19 statistics?

This is what my buddy Pierre and I decided to do in order to map the number of coronavirus-related deaths for France, based on the data issued by France's Regional Health Agency (ARS or *Agence Régionale de Santé*). Our goal was to represent the death toll per department, a French territorial subdivision.

In this post, I will describe our project's main steps.
By the time you are done reading, you should be able to produce a similar map to meet your needs; hopefully you will be working on a less depressing project. Let's dive in!

### Imports

The stars of the show are Folium and pandas, which we will use not only to load the data, but also to manipulate them.

```python
import folium
import numpy as np
import datetime
import pandas as pd
import unidecode
import branca.colormap as cm
colormap =cm.linear.YlOrRd_09.scale(0, 1000)
```

We also need to import the geographical coordinates of each department or *département*, which were stored in a dictionary inside an external .py file called `department.py`:

```python
coordinates={                
                  'DEP-29': [48.26111111, -4.058888889], 
                  'DEP-22': [48.44111111, -2.864166667], 
                  'DEP-56': [47.84638889, -2.81], 
                  ...
                  'DEP-95': [49.08277778, 2.131111111],
                  'DEP-2B': [42.39416667, 9.206388889],
                  'DEP-2A': [41.86361111, 8.988055556]
                  }                  
```

Associated with each department code (*e.g.* DEP-29) is a latitude and longitude pair (*e.g.*  [48.26111111, -4.058888889]). These coordinates were recovered from France's National Geographical Institute (IGN or *Institut Géographique National*).

```python
import department
```
