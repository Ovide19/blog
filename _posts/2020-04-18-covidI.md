Why not take advantage of python's Folium mapping library to visualize the COVID-19 statistics?

This is what my buddy [Pierre](pierre@nothos.net) and I decided to do in order to map the number of coronavirus-related deaths for metropolitan France, based on the data issued by France's Regional Health Agency (ARS). Our goal was to represent the death toll per department, or *département*, a French territorial subdivision. This may seem a rather macabre exercise, but actually helps visualize the nationwide progression of the virus.

In the next couple of posts, I will describe our project's main steps. The current post is dedicated to backend aspects, while the next one will focus on the webpage deployment. 
By the time you are done reading, you should be able to produce a similar map to meet your needs; hopefully you will be working on a less depressing project than this one... With that being said, let's dive in our python script!

### 1. Importing libraries and geographical coordinates

The stars of the show are `Folium` and `pandas`, which we will use not only to load the data, but also to manipulate them. We also import `branca`, a Folium spinoff allowing to create a colormap.

```python
import folium
import numpy as np
import datetime
import pandas as pd
import unidecode
import branca.colormap as cm
colormap =cm.linear.YlOrRd_09.scale(0, 1000)
```

We also need to load the geographical coordinates of each department, stored as a dictionary. It would be possible to have the dictionary directly in the main python script, but for the sake of housekeeping, we keep it inside an external file called `department.py`:

```python
coordinates={                
                  'DEP-29': [48.26111111, -4.058888889], 
                  'DEP-22': [48.44111111, -2.864166667], 
                  'DEP-56': [47.84638889, -2.81], 
                  ...
                  'DEP-95': [49.08277778, 2.131111111],
                  'DEP-2B': [42.39416667, 9.206388889],
                  'DEP-2A': [41.86361111, 8.988055556]
                  }                  
```

Associated with each department code (*e.g.* DEP-29) is a latitude and longitude pair (*e.g.*  [48.26111111, -4.058888889]), corresponding to the geographical center of the department, as recently computed by France's [National Geographical Institute](http://www.ign.fr/institut/actus/lign-calcule-centre-geographique-96-departements-metropolitains). 
We just import `department` as we would import any built-in library:

```python
import department
```

Right after the import block, we create an html legend providing the map's title and the data provenance:

```python
legend_html = '''
<div style="position: fixed;
     padding: .5em; top: 10px; left: 60px; width: 30em; height: 10em;
     border:2px solid grey; z-index:9999; font-size:14px; background: #eee;
     "> &nbsp; COVID-19 related deaths for Metropolitan France<br>
     &nbsp; Data recovered from https://github.com/opencovid19-fr/data  <br>
</div>
'''
```

### 2. Downloading the data from GitHub

Next, we need to download the data, hosted on the [Open COVID-19 GitHub page](https://github.com/opencovid19-fr). If you are even remotely interested into France's coronavirus stats, I strongly suggest that you check it out!

In order to fecth the data, we define `download_csv_from_github()`:

```python
def download_csv_from_github():
     download_start_time=datetime.datetime.now()
     data=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencovid19-fr/data/master/dist/chiffres-cles.csv')
     download_end_time=datetime.datetime.now()  
     download_duration=download_end_time-download_start_time
     return data, download_duration
```

This function is essentially a wrapper for pandas `read_csv` built-in function, which reads the csv hosted on GitHub and stores its content into a dataframe called `data`. The download start and end times just serve troubleshooting purpose and will be discussed in the next post.

### 3. Defining the CovidData class

We are now ready to roll! Let's define a class called `CovidData`. 

```python
class CovidData(object):
   
    def __init__(self):
         self.Data, self.download_duration = download_csv_from_github()
         self.Departements = departements.coordinates         
         self.Coordinates=pd.DataFrame.from_dict(self.Departements, orient='index')
         self.Coordinates['maille_code']=self.Coordinates.index         
         self.map = folium.Map(location=[46,2],
              tiles = 'Stamen Terrain',
              zoom_start=6)         
         self.merged_data_last = None

    def merge_data_and_coordinates(self):
         self.merged_data=self.Data.merge(self.Coordinates, left_on='maille_code', right_on='maille_code')

    def drop_rows_with_missing_info(self):
         self.merged_data=self.merged_data.dropna(subset=['deces'])

    def select_last_date(self):
         self.merged_data_last=self.merged_data.sort_values('date').groupby('maille_code').tail(1)

    def plot_departments(self,data,custom_color):
         radius = data['deces'].values.astype('float')
         latitude = data[0].values.astype('float')
         longitude = data[1].values.astype('float')
         name = data['maille_name'].values.astype('str')   
         latest_date = data['date'].values.astype('str')
         for la,lo,ra,na,ld in zip(latitude,longitude,radius,name,latest_date):
              label=unidecode.unidecode(na.replace("'","-"))+': '+str(ra)[:-2]+ ' victims by '+str(ld)+'.'
              folium.Circle(
                       location=[la,lo],
                       radius=5000*np.log(ra),
                       fill=True,
                       color='grey',
                       fill_color=colormap(ra),
                       fill_opacity=0.8
                   ).add_child(folium.Popup(label)).add_to(self.map)
```

Let's have a look at the different methods defined in here.

First, the `__init__` constructor initializes several attributes, among which:

- `Data`, the dataframe output by the aforementioned `download_csv_from_github` function.
- `Coordinates`, a dataframe containing the latitude and longitude for each department, built from the `coordinates` dictionary using the pandas `from_dict` function.
- `map`, our Folium map. Upon initialization, this is just a plain map of France. You will find that it takes a bit of fiddling to ajust the central latitude and longitude passed in the `location` parameter and to nail down a satisfying `zoom` level.  Here we also specify the `Stamen Terrain` theme in the `tiles` parameter; I suggest you check out [Folium's documentation](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html) for more info about the available skins.

As suggested by its name, `merge_data_and_coordinates` simply merges the `Data` and `Coordinates` dataframes, so that we can work with a single table.

`drop_rows_with_missing_info` weeds out the rows of the dataframe corresponding to dates for which the death toll is unknown.

Since we only want to display the most recent available information, we use `select_last_date` to group the data by department code, sort them by date and finally grab the last row using `tail`.

Last but not least, `plot_department` takes care of plotting the number of victims. Taking advantage of Folium's `Circle` method, this function plots for each department a disk whose radius is proportional to the number of victims. The radius is also used to define a colormap, with highly impacted areas shown in red. 

### 4. Creating the map

Now it's time to instantiate our newly defined class. We do this inside a function called `create_map`, which calls all of the previously defined methods one after the another. This function also adds the html legend to the map:

 ```python
 def create_map():
     CODA=CovidData()
     CODA.merge_data_and_coordinates()
     CODA.drop_rows_with_missing_info()
     CODA.select_last_date()
     CODA.plot_departments(CODA.merged_data_last,'grey')
     CODA.map.get_root().html.add_child(folium.Element(legend_html))
     colormap.caption = 'COVID-19 death toll per department (Source: opencovid19-fr)'
     CODA.map.add_child(colormap)
     return CODA

CODA = create_map()
```

Finally, the map can be saved as an html file.

 ```python
CODA.map.save("./COVID_map.html")
```

This map shows that the *Île de France* region around Paris and the *Grand Est* region are the most impacted so far.
Thanks to Folium's `add_child` method, clicking on a disk triggers a popup indicating the number of casualties for the corresponding department:
