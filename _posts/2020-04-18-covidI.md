Why not take advantage of Python's [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html) mapping library to visualize the COVID-19 statistics?

This is what my buddy Pierre and I decided to do in order to map the number of coronavirus-related deaths for metropolitan France, based on the data issued by France's Regional Health Agency (ARS or *Agence Régionale de Santé*). Our goal was to represent the death toll per department, or *département*, a French territorial subdivision.

In the next couple of posts, I will describe our project's main steps. The current post will be dedicated to backend aspects, while the next one will focus on the webpage deployment. 
By the time you are done reading, you should be able to produce a similar map to meet your needs; hopefully you will be working on a less depressing project! Let's dive in!

### Importing libraries and geographical coordinates

The stars of the show are Folium and pandas, which we will use not only to load the data, but also to manipulate them.

```python
import folium
import numpy as np
import datetime
import pandas as pd
import unidecode
import branca.colormap as cm
colormap =cm.linear.YlOrRd_09.scale(0, 1000)
```

We also need to load the geographical coordinates of each department, stored as a dictionary. It would be possible to have the dictionary directly in the main python script, but for the sake of housekeeping, we keep it inside an external file called `department.py`:

```python
coordinates={                
                  'DEP-29': [48.26111111, -4.058888889], 
                  'DEP-22': [48.44111111, -2.864166667], 
                  'DEP-56': [47.84638889, -2.81], 
                  ...
                  'DEP-95': [49.08277778, 2.131111111],
                  'DEP-2B': [42.39416667, 9.206388889],
                  'DEP-2A': [41.86361111, 8.988055556]
                  }                  
```

Associated with each department code (*e.g.* DEP-29) is a latitude and longitude pair (*e.g.*  [48.26111111, -4.058888889]), corresponding to the geographical center of the department, as computed by France's National Geographical Institute (IGN or [*Institut Géographique National*](http://www.ign.fr/institut/actus/lign-calcule-centre-geographique-96-departements-metropolitains)). 
We just need to import department like we would do with any built-in library:

```python
import department
```

### Downloading the data from GitHub

Next, we need to download the data, hosted on the [Open COVID-19 GitHub page] (https://github.com/opencovid19-fr). If you are even remotely interested into France's coronavirus stats, I strongly suggest that you check it out.

In order to do fecth the data, we define a function `download_csv_from_github()`:

```python
def download_csv_from_github():
     download_start_time=datetime.datetime.now()
     data=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencovid19-fr/data/master/dist/chiffres-cles.csv')
     download_end_time=datetime.datetime.now()  
     download_duration=download_end_time-download_start_time
     return data, download_duration
```

This is essentially a wrapper for pandas `read_csv` function, which stores the content of the csv file into a dataframe called data. The download start and end time just serve troubleshooting purpose and will be discussed later on.

### Define CovidData class

We are now ready to roll! Let's define a class called `CovidData`. 

```python
class CovidData(object):
   
    def __init__(self):
         self.Data, self.download_duration = download_csv_from_github()
         self.Departements = departements.coordinates         
         self.Coordinates=pd.DataFrame.from_dict(self.Departements, orient='index')
         self.Coordinates['maille_code']=self.Coordinates.index         
         self.map = folium.Map(location=[46,2],
              tiles = 'Stamen Terrain',
              zoom_start=6)         
         self.merged_data_last = None

    def merge_data_and_coordinates(self):
         self.merged_data=self.Data.merge(self.Coordinates, left_on='maille_code', right_on='maille_code')

    def drop_rows_with_missing_info(self):
         self.merged_data=self.merged_data.dropna(subset=['deces'])

    def select_last_date(self):
         self.merged_data_last=self.merged_data.sort_values('date').groupby('maille_code').tail(1)

    def plot_departments(self,data,custom_color):
         radius = data['deces'].values.astype('float')
         latitude = data[0].values.astype('float')
         longitude = data[1].values.astype('float')
         name = data['maille_name'].values.astype('str')   
         latest_date = data['date'].values.astype('str')
         for la,lo,ra,na,ld in zip(latitude,longitude,radius,name,latest_date):
              label=unidecode.unidecode(na.replace("'","-"))+': '+str(ra)[:-2]+ ' victims by '+str(ld)+'.'
              folium.Circle(
                       location=[la,lo],
                       radius=5000*np.log(ra),
                       fill=True,
                       color='grey',
                       fill_color=colormap(ra),
                       fill_opacity=0.8
                   ).add_child(folium.Popup(label)).add_to(self.map)
```

What's going on in here?

First, the `__init__` constructor initializes several attributes, among which:

- `Data`, the dataframe output by the aforementioned `download_csv_from_github` function.
- `Coordinates`, a dataframe containing the latitude and longitude for each department, built from the `coordinates` dictionary using the pandas `from_dict` function.
- `map`, our Folium map. Upon initialization, this is just a plain map of France. You will find that it takes bit of fiddling to ajust the central latitude and longitude passed in the `location` parameter and to nail down a satisfying `zoom` level. Folium comes with a plethora of built-in themes: here we use `Stamen Terrain`, as specified in `tiles`.

As suggested by its name, `merge_data_and_coordinates` simply merges the `Data` and `Coordinates` dataframes, so that we can work with a single table.

`drop_rows_with_missing_info` allows to weed out the dataframe rows corresponding to dates for which the death toll is unknown.

Since we only want to display the most recent available information, we use `select_last_date` to group the data by department code, sort them by date and finally grab the last row using `tail`.

Last but not least, `plot_department` takes care of plotting the number of victims. Taking advantage of Folium's `Circle` method, for each department it plots a disk whose radius is proportional to the number of victims. The radius is also used to define a colormap, which highly impacted areas shown in red. 

### Create the map

Now it's time to instantiate our newly defined class. We do this inside a function called `create_map`.

 ```python
 def create_map():
     CODA=CovidData()
     CODA.merge_data_and_coordinates()
     CODA.drop_rows_with_missing_info()
     CODA.select_last_date()
     CODA.plot_departments(CODA.merged_data_last,'grey')
     colormap.caption = 'COVID-19 death toll per department (Source: opencovid19-fr)'
     CODA.map.add_child(colormap)
     return CODA

Coda = create_map()
```
`create_map` also adds a colorbar to the map.

Finally, the map can be saved as an html file.

 ```python
Coda.map.save("./COVID_map.html")
```
