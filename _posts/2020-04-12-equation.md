With the COVID-19 lockdown slightly complicating this year's easter egg hunt, why not turn to digital easter eggs for fun?

If you are into electronic music, you probably heard of Aphex Twin's images hidden into some of the tracks of his 1999 "Windowlicker" album, such as the grinning face buried into the so-called ["Equation" track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i49ODCnEAZI). 

In this post, I will show you how you can easily uncover this concealed image with just a few Python lines. In the following, I will assume that you are working under your virtual environment in which numpy and SciPy are installed. Also, if you do not already own a copy of Aphex Twin's "Equation" track, now is the time to download it and to convert it to the WAV format; just save the file in your working directory. That being said, let's get started!

First, let's import `numpy`, `pyplot` and `wavfile`, a SciPy module allowing to read and write WAV files.
Here I also import `gridspec`, which will come in handy to create a nice looking plot with multiple subfigures, and `figure`, in order to control the figure size:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.io import wavfile
from matplotlib import gridspec
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
```

Given the path to the WAV file of interest, wavfile's `read` function returns its sampling rate and the associated data:

```python
fs, data = wavfile.read('./Aphex Twin - Strange Formula.wav')
```

`fs` is given in samples per second, or Hertz. Here fs is equal to 44100Hz, which is the common sampling frequency of mp3 files.

`data` consists of a numpy array of shape (15379456, 2). Considering the aforementioned sampling rate, 15379456 samples amount to 5 minutes and 48 seconds, which is indeed the duration of the "Equation" track. Typing `data.shape` reveals that  `data` actually consists of 2 arrays: these correspond to the left and right channels of the stereo recording.

Aphex Twin's face is said to be hidden towards the end of the track so let's take advantage of python's negative indexing to extract the last 30 seconds of the song, considering the first channel only:

```python
chunk=data[-fs*30:,0]
```
Now we can plot this chunk of data in both time and frequency domains.
`figure` allows us to specify the size of the plot in inches, while `gridspec` gives us control over the height ratio between subplots.

```python
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 20})
figure(figsize=(12, 8))
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(ncols=1, nrows=2, height_ratios=[1, 3]) 
ax0=plt.subplot(gs[0])
ax0.plot(np.arange(chunk.shape[0])/fs, chunk)
ax0.set_xlim(left=0,right=30)
ax1=plt.subplot(gs[1])
ax1.specgram(chunk, NFFT=1024, Fs=fs, cmap='terrain')
ax1.set_yscale('symlog')
ax1.set_xlabel('Seconds', fontsize=20)
ax1.set_ylabel('Frequency(Hz)', fontsize=20)
ax1.set_xlim(left=0,right=30)
ax1.set_ylim(bottom=500,top=16000)
```

`ax0.plot(np.arange(chunk.shape[0])/fs, chunk)` takes care of the time domain representation: since I want the abscissa to show the number of *seconds* rather than the number of *samples*, I plot the chunk of data against an array of samples normalized by the sampling rate, *i.e* `np.arange(chunk.shape[0])/fs`.

The frequency domain representation is obtained using matplotlib's `specgram` function: `ax1.specgram(chunk, NFFT=1024, Fs=fs, detrend='mean', cmap='terrain')`. This function takes several arguments:


- `NFFT`: this is the length of the segments into which the original data are split before being Fourier transformed.  
- `Fs` is the sampling rate; let's use the actual sampling rate `fs` that we recovered using wavfile's `read` function. 


Last but not least, I am using a log scale for the frequeny axis `ax1.set_yscale('symlog')`. Comment out this line, you will see the face distort.

*Et voil√†!*
