Let's use plotly's "figure factory" module to create powerful Gantt charts within minutes!

I just returned from Mayotte, where I took part to the MAY-MT geophysical survey aiming to provide additional insight about [the volcano that was recently discovered about 50km offshore the island](http://www.ipgp.fr/en/underwater-volcano-off-mayotte-looking-back-at-an-exceptional-discovery).
While in the field, I used [plotly's "figure factory" gantt chart function](https://plotly.github.io/plotly.py-docs/generated/plotly.figure_factory.create_gantt.html) to keep track of our magnetotelluric data acquisition schedule.

Once back home, I decided to keep exploring the functionalities offered by this tool. While looking for data to fiddle with, I came across [Oslo's City Bike historical data](https://oslobysykkel.no/en/open-data/historical) and figured it would be perfect to get started.

Virtually every major European city now has its own bike renting system, but what makes Oslo City Bike's initiative special is that they collect bicycle trip data and even better, make them available under both json and csv formats.

### 1. Inspecting the data

The anonymised trip data are stored as monthly files on Oslo City Bike's website. Only trips longer than a minute are recorded, thus preventing cancelled trips from being counted. 
Let's go ahead and download any csv file from their website: in the following, we'll work with the file provided for June 2020, named `06.csv`:

```python
import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv("./06.csv")
```

Each trip corresponds to a single row in the csv, detailing the bike ride's start and end time, labelled `started_at` and `ended_at` respectively, as well as the start and end station names and identifiers, labelled `start_station_name`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_name` and `end_station_id`.
On top of that, there are the trip's duration, expressed in seconds, and the geographical coordinates for each station, which we will not use for the time being.


### 2. Getting started with plotly

Plotly is the name to a Montreal-based company developing a series of data viz tools, among which the eponymous open-source graphing library for Python. There are at least two different implementations of Gantt charts in plotly that I can think of:

- **Plotly express**, a high-level interface to plotly.
- **Figure factory**, a module dedicated to creating very specific types of plots.

We will rely on the latter module in the following:

```python
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
```

Let's also import the `plotly.offline.plot()` function, that will allow us to generate graphs offline and save them locally:


```python
from plotly.offline import plot
```

#### 3. Creating the Gantt chart

Our purpose will be to simply display all bike trips on a given day, for a chosen start station.
The bare minimum information that ff's `create_gantt` function needs to do this are:

- A **Task** column, describing the task to display. In this example, we want to display the bike trips from a single station to all stations, so we will pass the names of the end stations as our tasks.
- A **Start** column, containing the start date and time for each task.
- A **Finish** column, containing the start date and time for each task.

Let's create these three columns:

```python
df['Task']=df['end_station_name']
df['Start']=df['started_at']
df['Finish']=df['ended_at']
```

Let's then specify the id of the station to analyze:

```python
id_of_station_to_analyze=503
```

This corresponds to a station called Fagerheimgata:

```python
name_of_station_to_analyze=df[df['start_station_id']==id_of_station_to_analyze]['start_station_name'][0]
```

Let's also specify the date of interest, for instance June 3, 2020:

```python
day_to_analyze=datetime.date(2020,6,3)
```

We will derive the start and end date (as strings) from this variable:

```python
start_time=day_to_analyze.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")+" 00:00:00"
end_time=day_to_analyze.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")+" 23:59:59"
```

Now let's filter our Pandas dataframe accordingly, selecting only the bike trips starting at Fagerheimgata between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 on June 3, 2020:

```python
df=df[df['start_station_id']==id_of_station_to_analyze]
df=df[df['started_at'].between(start_time,end_time)]
df=df.reset_index()
```

The only thing left to do is create a title for our plot...

```python
title="From "+name_of_station_to_analyze+" to..."
```

...and then call `create_gantt`

```python
fig1 = ff.create_gantt(df, title=title, group_tasks=True, height=1000)
plot(fig1)
```

The beauty is that `create_gantt` does all the heavy lifting here! 

Finally, calling `plot(fig1)` will simply create an offline interactive html figure.

There is some information to be gained simply by looking at the plot: for instance, we can see that Fagerheimgata is busiest between 6AM and 7AM, which makes sense since June 3 was a weekday.

A small caveat here: note that we passed `group_tasks` as `True`, which means that overlapping bike rides towards any given end_station will show up as a single horizontal bar. This means that if a family or a group of friends decide to ride together from Fagerheimgata to Henrik Ibsens gate, this will show up as a single bike ride. This could be refined to reflect the actual number of overlapping bike trips.

One last thing: the output of `create_gantt`, `fig1`, is stored as a plotly figure, a data structure containing a bunch of information.
Not only can the layout information be accessed through `fig1.layout`, but it can also be modified using the `update` method.
For instance, you can use this to specify the left and right bounds of the figure, in a similar fashion to setting axes range in matplotlib:

```python
fig1.layout['xaxis'].update(range=[start_time, end_time])
```
